why do we need methods.

The same function printSummary can be written as a simple function 
instead of a methods


func PrintSummary(c computer){
    print(c.Maker)
    /// etc 
    
}

// go is not pure OOP language. it doesnt support classes, hence we need 
methods as a way to achieve this functionality

the receiver in method can be though of an equivalent to "this" or "self" in OOP langugaes.

Methods with the same name can be defined on different types 
whereas functions with the same names are not allowed. 
Let's assume that we have a Square and Circle structure. 
It's possible to define a method named Area on both Square 
and Circle. 
This is done in the program below.

func (r rectangle) Area(){

}

func (c circle) Area(){

}

// The same is not allowed in functions
