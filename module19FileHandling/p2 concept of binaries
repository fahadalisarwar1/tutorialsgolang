if the same program is compiled into a binary file, there would be an error while running the program from somewhere else since the
text file is located on a local system and cant be accessed from somewhere else


 There are some ways to overcome this problem
 1: Give the function absolute path of the file
 2: passing the path as a command line flag
 3: bundling the file along with the executable
