Go is not a strict Object oriented programming which is very different from other languages from Python or C++

Go has structs instead of classes in comparison to the OOP nature of programming languages.

These structs provide somewhat similar functionality

As we have already seen methods can be invoked on structs, and structs can be bundled into packages.
